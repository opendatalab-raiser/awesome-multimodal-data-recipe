<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Paper**: [MMEvol: Empowering Multimodal Large Language Models with Evol-Instruct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05840)

**Institution**: Alibaba DAMO Academy (Fei Huang, Yongbin Li, et al.)

**📊 Data Synthesis Method (Explicitly Described)**:

MMEvol proposes a **multimodal instruction evolution framework** that iteratively enhances data quality and complexity:

1. **Core Method - Evol-Instruct Paradigm** (Based on text-domain Evol-Instruct):
   - Starts from initial seed data **SEED-163K**
   - **Iterative Evolution**: Continuously improves instruction data through multiple rounds
   - Three evolution dimensions:
     a) **Fine-grained Perception**: Mines detailed information in images
     b) **Cognitive Reasoning**: Extends visual reasoning steps to enhance reasoning capabilities
     c) **Interaction Evolution**: Enhances diversity of instruction types

2. **Data Evolution Pipeline**:
   - Initial instruction → Evolution operation → More complex/diverse instructions
   - Systematically expands instruction type diversity
   - Gradually increases visual reasoning complexity
   - Deeply explores fine-grained information in images

3. **Experimental Results** (Section 5):
   - Compared to baseline models (using seed data), **average accuracy improvement of 3.1 percentage points**
   - **Achieves SOTA on 9 tasks** with less data
   - Comprehensive evaluation on 13 vision-language tasks

**Data Scale**:
- Initial seed: SEED-163K
- Generates more diverse and complex data through evolution

**✅ Paper**: 
- [arXiv:2409.05840](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05840)
- Latest version: v5 (December 31, 2024)

### ByteDance - Oasis

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

**Paper**: [Oasis: One Image is All You Need for Multimodal Instruction Data Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.08741v2)

**📊 Data Synthesis Method (Section 3.2 Detailed Description)**:

**This is breakthrough work!** Oasis proposes a minimalist data synthesis method, inspired by Magpie but applied to the multimodal domain:

1. **Core Innovation - "Hooking" Prompt** (Section 3.2 Step 1):

   **Key Breakthrough**:
   - **Only inputs images**, no text prompts required!
   - Lets MLLM (e.g., Qwen2-VL) generate instructions itself
   - Utilizes the auto-regressive nature of models to automatically generate diverse questions based on images

   **Why It Works**:
   - Breaks traditional fixed prompt patterns, significantly enhancing data diversity
   - Models generate questions based on their knowledge, providing broader coverage
   - Simple and efficient, no need for manually designed complex prompts

2. **Data Categorization** (Section 3.2 Step 2):
   - Uses LLM to filter out non-instruction data (e.g., pure descriptive text)
   - Ensures all generated data are in question-answer format

3. **Four-Dimensional Quality Control** (Section 3.2 Step 3, Appendix B.2 fully disclosed):

   The paper designs rigorous quality assessment criteria (1-5 scale):

   a) **Solvability**: Whether the image contains sufficient information to answer the question
   b) **Hallucination**: Whether the question is consistent with image content
   c) **Clarity**: Whether the question is clearly expressed
   d) **Nonsense**: Whether the question is grammatically correct and logically sound

   - Each dimension has detailed scoring criteria (Appendix B.2 complete prompts)
   - Multi-dimensional comprehensive assessment ensures high quality

**Data Scale**:
- Generated 500K high-quality instruction data
- Validated effectiveness on LLaVA-NeXT

**Domain Customization Capability**:
- Since it only depends on images, domain-specific data can be generated by controlling image sources
- Paper demonstrates OCR domain cases (Section 4.3)

**Experimental Results** (Section 4.2):
- Significant performance improvement on 14 benchmarks
- Outperforms other data synthesis methods (including LLaVA, ALLAVA, MMEvol, etc.)

**Comparison Methods Mentioned in Oasis Paper** (Section 4.2):
- **LLaVA** [24]: GPT-4 assisted generation (entry below, see "LLaVA Series")
- **MMEvol** [29]: Alibaba DAMO Academy's image-text instruction evolution framework (entry above, see "Alibaba - MMEvol")
- **ALLaVA** [4]: Captioning-then-QA approach (entry below, see "Methods by Image Processing Type")

**Oasis Inspiration Source**:
- **Magpie** [43]: Text-domain self-aligned instruction generation method (inspired Oasis's "hooking prompt" core idea)
  - Oasis extends Magpie's idea to the multimodal domain, achieving instruction generation with only images

**✅ Fully Open Source**: 
- Paper promises to open-source 500K data and models
- All quality control prompts are publicly available in Appendix B

**Significance**:
- **Minimalist Methodology**: Only requires images, no captions or other text needed
- **Quality Assurance**: Four-dimensional quality control is highly systematic
- **Reproducible**: All prompts and methods are fully disclosed
